# Tutorial Setup

## Overview

One of the goals of this tutorial is to teach you how to leverage efforts of dozens of differnet open source projects 
who have invested decades of man-years into the advancement of science, computation, data management, identity and 
access management, security, reproducibility, ui/ux, collaboration, and publishing. While this tutorial is not focused 
on any one specific area, we hope that by providing a consistent, holistic approach to utilizing containers and cloud 
services in your computational and data science research, we can help you accelerate your research velocity and 
improve the reproducibility of your experiments. 

During this tutorial you will primarily interact with two interfaces which will leverage many of the low-level details required to accomplish our goals for today.
