# Overview and introductions

## Problem 


We should get them each a VM on JetStream. Let them work from a known code that we’re already building as an image. If we leveraging autobuilds of their code, we can wave our hands on the docker and singularity 101 while pointing out a strength of the “ecosystem”.

That means they can use jupyter as a scripting environment and a “nearly” interactive execution environment.

once they have the build, test, run, monitor feedback loop down,

Then we can just walk them through running the containers on other apps, running a native version of the app, and finish with some light viz of their job output in jupyter and some charts showing native vs docker vs singularity execution performance for the same code
