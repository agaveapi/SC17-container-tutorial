## Tutorial notebooks


What do we think about providing the following notebooks for this tutorial

## App building and publish

* Docker Hub, Singularity Hub, AX as starting points
* Checkout code from this repo
* Copy assets from Agave public storage
* Edit code and/or asset
* Manual build 
* Interactively run locally 

## App Run and Scale demo

* Run local assets remotely with `run-this-code`
* See results
* Commit and auto-build via agave
* Run remotely via `cloud-runner`
* See results
* Share apps with each other via Agave and run across multiple systems.
* See aggregate results

## Result analysis, visualization, sharing, and publishing

* Job history
* File browsing
* Charts, graphs, batch rendering
* Sharing via Agave ACL
* Publishing files
* Packaging and sharing experiments 
 
## Performance analysis

* Run app with singularity, docker, and fork on VM
  * Generate chart to display time, management overhead, CPU, memory, IO, disk utilization
  * Calculate output diffs
* Run app with singularity, docker, and batch scheduler on HPC system
  * Generate chart to display time, management overhead, CPU, memory, IO, disk utilization
  * Calculate output diffs
